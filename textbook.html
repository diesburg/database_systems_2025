</ul>

		<p>If you have taken this class before, you may be able to get a subscription to your textbook for free or a reduced cost!  Please see <a href="https://support.zybooks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007439634-If-I-am-retaking-a-class-can-I-get-a-discount">this FAQ</a> for directions.</p>
	
	<p>It's easiest to buy the textbook directly from zyBooks without going to the bookstore.  However, if you need to purchase all your textbooks through the UNI bookstore for financial aid reasons, you can buy a pre-paid access key from the UNI bookstore.  Then, when you sign into <a href="http://learn.zybooks.com">learn.zybooks.com</a>, you will need <b>both the zyBook code and the pre-paid access key</b> to gain access to the textbook.  See <a href="https://support.zybooks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007536753-What-is-a-prepaid-access-key">this FAQ</a> for directions on how to enter the pre-paid access key.</p>
	

	<p><b>You will be graded on doing assigned participation and challenge activities, starting on the first week of class!</b> If your financial aid has not yet come through to purchase the book, zyBooks will work with you to provide you access to the textbook until you can set up payment!  Please follow <a href="https://support.zybooks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007439574-How-to-request-a-temporary-subscription-to-a-zyBook">these directions</a> to request deferrment and get access to the textbook. </p>
